**Personal notes** How to use LimeSurvey and some tips

## Adding a new user

In a v3 instance:

1. Click on the `Configuration` top menu then select `Manage survey administrators`,
2. On the left part, click on the `Add user` (it's silly but the button is on the left and not on the right),
3. Fill in the `Add a new survey administrator` popup,
4. A new form will be opened to give permissions.

The easiest way to proceed is to open a new window by displaying the existing permission of someone and to give the sames (if applicable).
